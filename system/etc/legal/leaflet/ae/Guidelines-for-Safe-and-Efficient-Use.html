      <div class="nested1" id="Emergency-calls"><h2>Emergency calls</h2><div>
<p>Calls cannot be guaranteed under all conditions. Never rely solely upon Sony mobile devices for essential communication. Calls may not be possible in all areas, on all networks, or when certain network services and/or mobile device features are used. Please note that some Sony devices are not capable of supporting voice calls, including emergency calls.</p>
</div><div/>
         

      </div>
      <div class="nested1" id="Antenna"><h2>Antenna</h2><div>
<p>Use of antenna devices not marketed by Sony could damage the mobile device, reduce performance, and produce Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) levels above the established limits. Do not cover the antenna with your hand as this affects call quality, power levels, and can shorten talk and standby times.</p>
</div><div/>
         

      </div>
      <div class="nested1" id="Radio-frequency-(RF)-exposure-and-Specific-Absorption-Rate-(SAR)"><h2>Radio Frequency (RF) exposure and Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)</h2><div>
<p>When the mobile device or Bluetooth handsfree functionality is turned on, it emits low levels of radio frequency energy. International safety guidelines have been developed through periodic and thorough evaluation of scientific studies. These guidelines establish permitted levels of radio wave exposure. The guidelines include a safety margin designed to assure the safety of all persons and to account for any variations in measurements.</p>
<p>Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is used to measure radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile device. The SAR value is determined at the highest certified power level in laboratory conditions, but because the device is designed to use the minimum power necessary to access the chosen network, the actual SAR level can be well below this value. There is no proof of difference in safety based on difference in SAR value.</p>
<p>Products with radio transmitters sold in the US must be certified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). When required, tests are performed when the device is placed at the ear and when worn on the body. For body-worn operation, the device has been tested when positioned a minimum of <span class="keep-together">15 mm</span> from the body without any metal parts in the vicinity of the device or when properly used with an appropriate Sony accessory and worn on the body. When operating with “Hotspot” functionality engaged, a separation distance of 10 mm was used.</p>
