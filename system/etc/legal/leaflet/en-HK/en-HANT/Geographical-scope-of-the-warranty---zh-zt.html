<h1>Country specific terms</h1>
<div>
<p>If you have purchased your Product in a country/region member of the European Economic Area (EEA) or in Switzerland or the Republic of Turkey, and such Product was intended for sale in the EEA or in Switzerland or in Turkey, you can have your Product serviced in any EEA country/region or in Switzerland or in Turkey, under the warranty conditions prevailing in the country/region in which you require servicing, provided that an identical Product is sold in such country/region by an authorised <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> distributor. To find out if your Product is sold in the country/region you are in, please call the local <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> Contact Center. Please observe that certain services may not be possible elsewhere than in the country/region of original purchase, for example due to the fact that your Product may have an interior or exterior which is different from equivalent models sold in other countries/regions. Please note in addition that it may sometimes not be possible to repair SIM-locked Products.</p>
<p>Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. If you purchased your product in Australia, you are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure. For warranty service in Australia, please contact 1300 650 050 or Sony Service Centre, 320 Princes Hwy, ROCKDALE NSW 2216.</p>
<p>** In some countries/regions additional information (such as a valid warranty card) may be requested.</p>
