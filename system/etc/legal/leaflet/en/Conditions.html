<div class="p"> <ol>
<li>This Limited Warranty is valid only if the original proof of purchase
for this Product issued by a Sony authorised dealer specifying the
date of purchase and serial number**, is presented with the Product
to be repaired or replaced. Sony reserves the right to refuse warranty
service if this information has been removed or changed after the
original purchase of the Product from the dealer.</li>
<li>If Sony repairs or replaces the Product, the repair for the defect
concerned, or the replaced Product shall be warranted for the remaining
time of the original warranty period or for ninety (90) days from
the date of repair, whichever is longer. Repair or replacement may
involve the use of functionally equivalent reconditioned units. Replaced
parts or components will become the property of Sony.</li>
<li> <p>This warranty does not cover any failure of the Product that
is due to:</p> <ul>
<li><p>Normal wear and tear.</p></li>
<li><p>Use in environments where relevant IP rating limitations, if
applicable, are exceeded (including liquid damage or the detection
of liquid inside the device resulting from such use).</p></li>
<li><p>Misuse or failure to use in accordance with the Sony instructions
for use and maintenance of the Product. </p></li>
</ul><p>Nor does this warranty cover any failure of
the Product due to accident, software or hardware modification or
adjustment, or acts of God.</p><p>A rechargeable battery can be charged
and discharged more than a hundred times. However, it will eventually
wear out – this is not a defect and corresponds to normal wear and
tear. When the talk-time or standby time is noticeably shorter, it
is time to replace the battery. Sony recommends that you use only
batteries and chargers approved by Sony.</p> <p>Minor variations in
display brightness and colour may occur between devices. There may
be tiny bright or dark dots on the display. It occurs when individual
dots have malfunctioned and can not be adjusted. Two defective pixels
are deemed acceptable.</p> <p>Minor variations in camera image appearance
may occur between devices. This is nothing uncommon and is not regarded
as a defective camera module.</p> </li>
<li>Since the cellular system on which the Product is to operate is
provided by a carrier independent from Sony, Sony will not be responsible
for the operation, availability, coverage, services or range of that
system.</li>
<li> This warranty does not cover Product failures caused by installations,
modifications, or repair or opening of the Product performed by a
non-Sony authorised person.</li>
<li> <p>The warranty does not cover Product failures which have been
caused by use of accessories or other peripheral devices which are
not Sony branded original accessories intended for use with the Product.</p> <p>Sony disclaims any and all warranties, whether express or implied,
for failures caused to the Product or peripheral devices as a result
of viruses, trojan horses, spyware, or other malicious software. Sony
strongly recommends that you install appropriate virus protection
software on your Product and any peripheral devices connected to it,
as available, and update it regularly, to better protect your device.
It is understood, however, that such software will never fully protect
your Product or its peripheral devices and Sony disclaims all warranties,
whether express or implied, in case of failure by such antivirus software
to fulfil its intended purpose. </p> </li>
<li>Tampering with any of the seals on the Product will void the warranty.</li>
<li> <span class="">THERE ARE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, WHETHER
WRITTEN OR ORAL, OTHER THAN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARE LIMITED TO THE DURATION OF
THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. IN NO EVENT SHALL SONY OR ITS LICENSORS BE
LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS OR COMMERCIAL LOSS TO THE
FULL EXTENT THOSE DAMAGES CAN BE DISCLAIMED BY LAW.</span> </li>
</ol> </div>
<p> Some countries/states do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, or
limitation of the duration of implied warranties, so the preceding
limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
<p>The warranty provided does not affect the consumer’s statutory
rights under applicable legislation in force, nor the consumer’s rights
against the dealer arising from their sales / purchase contract. </p>
