<li>This Limited Warranty is valid only if the original proof of purchase for this Product issued by a <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> authorized dealer specifying, unaltered, the date of purchase and serial number*, is presented with the Product to be repaired or replaced.</li>
<li>Subject to local legislation, repairs to, or replacement of, the Product shall be warranted for the remaining time of the original warranty period or for ninety (90) days from the date of repair, whichever is longer unless otherwise required by local legislation. Repair or replacement may involve the use of functionally equivalent components or units. Replaced parts, components or units will become the property of <span class="keep-together">Sony</span>.</li>
<li>This warranty does not cover failure of the Product due to normal wear and tear, or misuse, including but not limited to use in other than the normal manner, in accordance with the <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> instructions for use and maintenance. Nor will this warranty cover failure of the Product due to accident, software or hardware modification, acts of God or damage resulting from liquid or humidity.</li>
<li>
<p>A rechargeable battery can be charged and discharged more than a hundred times. However, it will eventually wear out – this is not a defect and corresponds to normal wear and tear. When the talk-time or standby time is noticeably shorter, replace your battery.</p>
<p>There may be tiny bright or dark dots on the display. These are non-functioning pixels which cannot be adjusted. Up to two non-functioning pixels are deemed acceptable and will not constitute warranted defect.</p>
<p>Minor variations in camera image appearance may occur between phones. This is not regarded as a warranted defect.</p>
</li>
<li>The Product operates on a cellular system provided by a carrier independent from <span class="keep-together">Sony</span>. <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> is not responsible for that system.</li>
<li>This warranty does not cover Product failures caused by work on the Product performed by anyone not expressly authorised by <span class="keep-together">Sony</span>.</li>
<li>The warranty does not cover Product failures or under-performances caused by use of <span class="keep-together">non-Sony</span> branded original accessories or other peripheral devices.</li>
<li><span class="keep-together">Sony</span> disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, for failures caused by viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or other malicious software.</li>
<li>Some Products may provide or support GPS/Location based functions. Location determining functionality is provided "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS". <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> does not make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such location information. Use of location-based information by the device may not be uninterrupted or error free and may additionally be dependent on network service availability. Please note that functionality may be reduced or prevented in certain environments such as building interiors or areas adjacent to buildings.</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>This Limited Warranty sets out your entire rights and remedies against <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> in relation to a defective Product. All implied warranties, including without limitation warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose are excluded. In no event shall <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> or its licensors be liable for incidental or consequential damages of any nature whatsoever, or for lost profits, time or commercial loss, to the fullest extent these damages can be disclaimed by law.</strong>
</p>
<p>Some countries/states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, or limitation of the duration of implied warranties, so the preceding limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. For jurisdictions where absolute exclusions of implied warranties is not permitted, such warranties, if applicable, shall not exceed the duration of the express warranties provided.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Warranty does not affect consumers’ statutory rights under applicable legislation.</p>
</li>
</ol> *In some countries/regions other information may be requested. </div>
